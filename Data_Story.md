Climate change is a hot topic that needs to draw people's attention more than ever. Using the YouNiverse dataset, we observe the influence of the topic in YouTubeâ€™s videos. As any social media, YouTube's data reflects the interest of its users and with the analysis of climate change, we can examine the emergence of people awareness' on environment. In our analysis, we compare view peaks of climate change related videos and particular events such as a natural disaster or political decision at that moment to make a connection between the two. We also look at the viral videos on climate change and analyse what subject related to the environment people are the most sensitive to.
