Climate change is a hot topic that needs to draw people's attention more than ever. Using the YouNiverse dataset, we observe the influence of the topic in YouTubeâ€™s videos. As any social media, YouTube's data reflects the interest of its users and with the analysis of climate change, we can examine the emergence of people awareness' on environment. In our analysis, we compare view peaks of climate change related videos and particular events such as a natural disaster or political decision at that moment to make a connection between the two. We also look at the viral videos on climate change and analyse what subject related to the environment people are the most sensitive to.

## More Politics on Youtube!
<p style='text-align: justify;'>  
In our first part of our analysis, we are examining the general interest in political videos on YouTube. Therefore, we focus on the three categories which potentially could include political videos, that is "News & Politics", "People & Blogs", and "Nonprofits & Activism" and plot the amount of quarterly released videos and the quartaly total views per category. One interesting finding from our analysis of YouTube videos is that the "News & Politics" category seems to be experiencing rapid growth. Specifically, the number of videos in this category appears to be increasing exponentially, and the number of views is following a similar trend. 
</p>


<p style='text-align: justify;'>  
This suggests that there is a high level of interest in this type of content among YouTube users.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>  
There are a few potential reasons for this growth. It could be that more and more people are turning to YouTube for their news and political information, or that the quality and diversity of content in this category is improving. Alternatively, it could be that the algorithms used by YouTube are promoting this type of content more heavily, leading to increased visibility and engagement.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>  
Overall, the exponential growth of the news and politics category on YouTube highlights the important role that this platform plays in the distribution of information and the formation of public opinion. It will be interesting to see how this trend continues to evolve over time.

### It is all Gloom and Doom in politics
<p style='text-align: justify;'>  
In the previous part, we have seen that the interest in political videos is growing rapidly. Thus, we are interested in analyzing the user behaviour and the general interaction with political videos in comparison to non-political videos. Therefore, we analyze the general sentiment per video category and the so defined "Heat metric", which is calculated as follows:
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>  
According to our analysis of the sentiment of 74m YouTube video descriptions, it looks like it is all gloom and doom in news&politics category. In fact, when we compared the sentiment scores of videos across different categories, the news and politics category came out with the lowest scores of all.
</p>
  
<p style='text-align: justify;'>  
It was also always the worst overtime.
</p>


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
And if that wasn't enough, it also had the highest Heat Metric.
</p>


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
It consistently had the highest Heat overtime.
</p>


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Looks like people are not too happy with current political topics and events happening around the world - It looks like it could use a little bit of good vibes!
